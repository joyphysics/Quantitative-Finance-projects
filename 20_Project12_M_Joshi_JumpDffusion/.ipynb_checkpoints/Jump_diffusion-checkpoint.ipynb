    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jump Diffusion Model is a stochastic model widely used in quantitative finance to describe asset prices exhibiting both continuous price fluctuations (diffusions) and sudden, discrete price jumps. The most common variant is the Merton Jump-Diffusion Model, developed by Robert Merton in 1976. It extends the classical Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) used in the Black-Scholes model by incorporating rare but significant jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why Jump Diffusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional models, such as Black-Scholes (based purely on continuous processes), fail to capture significant empirical features:\n",
    "- Fat-tailed distributions: Observed price returns often have heavier tails than those predicted by the normal distribution.\n",
    "- Implied volatility smiles and skews: Option markets frequently exhibit volatility patterns inconsistent with standard GBM.\n",
    "- Sudden market moves: Large and abrupt price changes due to unexpected news/events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jump Diffusion Model addresses these shortcomings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Mathematical Formulation\n",

    "Merton's Jump Diffusion Model:\n",
    "The stock price $S_t$ evolves according to the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n",

    "\\frac{d S_t}{S_t}=\\mu d t+\\sigma d W_t+d J_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the drift (expected rate of return).\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the volatility (standard deviation of continuous returns).\n",
    "- $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion (Wiener process).\n",
    "- $J_t$ is a pure jump process independent of $W_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump Component $J_t$ :\n",
    "- $J_t$ represents the cumulative jump size at time $t$.\n",
    "- It is modeled typically as a compound Poisson process:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "A Poisson process $N_t$ with intensity $\\lambda>0$ is defined by:\n",
    "- $N_0=0$\n",
    "- For $0 \\leq t_1<t_2<\\cdots<t_n$, the increments $N_{t_j}-N_{t_{j-1}}$ are independent and each has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda\\left(t_j-t_{j-1}\\right)$.\n",

    "- The expected number of jumps up to time $t$ is $\\mathbb{E}\\left[N_t\\right]=\\lambda t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Jump-Size Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a jump occurs (i.e., at each arrival time of $N_t$ ), the asset price multiplies by a random factor $Y$. We typically assume:\n",

    "- Consider the jump process over a small interval $d t$ :\n",
    "- Probability of exactly one jump is $\\lambda d t$.\n",
    "- Probability of more than one jump in $d t$ is $o(d t)$ (negligible).\n",
    "- Probability of no jump is $1-\\lambda d t$.\n",
